Graph is collection of Nodes and Connections

Uses:
 Social N/Ws
 Location/Mapping
 Roting Algotithms
 Visual Hierarchy
 File Systen Optimizations.
 Everywhere


 Vertex - a node
 Edge - a connection between nodes

 Types of Graphs.
  undirected graph - no direction b/w edges
  directed  graph - one direction b/w edges

  weighted graph - a value is assigned to edges
  un weighted graph - no value is assigned to edges

  Storing Graphs:

  Adjancy Matrix :     A    B     C
                    A  0    1     1
                    B  1    0     0
                    C  0    1     0


  Adjancy List:    [

               0    [1, 5],  connection from node 0 to 1 and 5
               1    [2, 5],
               2    [3, 4],
               3    [5, 2],
               4
               5
                     ]


      Differences & BIG 0
      
      |V| - no of vertices
      |E| - no of edges
