write a fucntion to calcualte the sum of all numbers from 1 up to n.

function addUpto1(n) {
    let total = 0;
    for(let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        total = total + i;
    }
    return total;
}


function addUpto2(n) {
    return n * (n + 1) / 2;
}

so here both funtions will solve the given problem. But which one is the best.


What does Best means?

1. Faster?
2. Less memory intensive?
3. More readable.?
4. Brevity.?

But Speed and Memory are important when we decide which one is the best

But sometime time is only fraction of seconds and it varies on machine configurations 
But number of simple operations must be considered because those are constants in all machines.

so in second functions *, +, / are 3 opeartions.


Running time of an algorithm depends on input size(n)

To analyze the performance of an algorithm , we use Big O Notation.

Big O notation can give us time and space complexity.
