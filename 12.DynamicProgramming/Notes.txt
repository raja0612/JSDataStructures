A method of solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems
, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing thier solutions.

It only works on problems with
Overlapping subproblem and Optimal substructure.

Overlapping subproblem : A problem is said to have overlapping subproblem if it can be broken down into subproblems
which are reused several times.

Optimal substructure : A problem is said to have Optimal substructure if an optimal solution can be constructed from
optimal solutions of its subproblems.
